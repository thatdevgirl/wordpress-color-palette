# WordPress Color Palette

This WordPress plugin adds a Color Palette block to the post editor, to be used for branding and style guide pages.

## The Color Palette block

The __Color Palette__ block displays a group of colors on your page. The block starts with 3 individual __Color__ blocks, but you can add additional blocks or remove excess blocks as needed.

Give each color block a color using the selector in the Inspector Panel on the right-hand side of the editor, give your color a name, and you're done!

If you are feeling a bit uninspired about color names, the __Color__ block will automatically generate one for you. _(Don't worry. You can always change the name to something different.)_ Thank you to the [Name That Color](https://chir.ag/projects/ntc/) library for that functionality.

### What is displayed

Each color in the palette will display a swatch of the selected color, the color name, as well as the Hex, RGB, and CMYK values for that color.

## Palette color block styles

You can select the "Color block style" inside the __Color Palette__ block by using the options in the Inspector Panel. The style options include:

* __Basic card:__ Each color is displayed in a rectangular card with minimal additional styles. This option is the easiest to override in your theme styles.
* __Stylized card:__ Each color is displayed in a rectangular card, just like the basic card, but with a bit more design added to it.
* __Circle:__ Each color is displayed as a circle of color, with the name and color values centered underneath the circle of color.

## Color code options

Inside the __Color Palette__ block, you can select which color codes (Hex, RGB, or CMYK) should be hidden on the page. These options are in the Inspector Panel and apply to _all_ color blocks inside the palette.

## Search option

You can optionally include search functionality inside the __Color Palette__ block, via an option in the Inspector Panel. If enabled, a keyword search form will appear above the color blocks inside the palette, that will allow an end-user to search for any color in the palette by name.

## Reusability

If you need to use the same color palette on multiple pages or posts, simply save the __Color Palette__ block with all of your colors as a reusable block via the post editor.
